    <h1>🛡Welcome to HalfXP!🛡</h1>
    <h2>The newbie-friendly Alliance guild on Icecrown!</h2>
    <p>
      We're focussed on levelling, questing, addons, lore, questions you have.
      In other words: PvE and Social stuff.
    </p>
    <p>No end-game stuff (though we're not against it); Dungeons are fine :)</p>

    <h2>❓How to invite people</h2>
    <p>We don't do that by hand; here's a macro:</p>
    <pre>
        /script n=GetNumWhoResults(); i=1; while(i&lt;n+1) do c, g=GetWhoInfo(i); if(g=="") then SendChatMessage("Hi, "..c.."! HalfXP is a newbie-friendly guild for people who play with 0.5x XP, or just play casually; Care to join?", "WHISPER", "COMMON", c); GuildInvite(c); end; i=i+1; end;
    </pre>

    </p>

    <h2>👶I'm new, how do I guild?</h2>
    <p>
      Press the <kbd>o</kbd> key to open the <em>social</em> window, and find
      the <em>guild tab</em> and the bottom.
    </p>

    <h2>🤔Why join?</h2>
    <p>
      So you have a place to interact with a bunch of nerds if you want to know
      more about the game, be it addons, lore, question, gear, etc.
